    <p class="p-recipe">
      A close-up, high-angle shot of a vibrant bowl of Nigerian Fried Rice. The
      rice is a bright, appetizing golden-yellow-green hue, perfectly grainy and
      non-sticky. It is generously mixed with small, neat cubes of dark brown
      sautéed liver, tiny pink shrimps, bright orange diced carrots, vibrant
      green peas, sliced green beans, and golden sweet corn. A few strips of
      fresh green bell pepper are scattered on top. The bowl is a rustic ceramic
      dish, steam is lightly rising, and it sits on a wooden table with a side
      of golden-brown fried plantain (dodo) partially visible. High-end food
      photography style, natural lighting

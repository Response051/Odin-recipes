    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Nigerian Bean Porridge is a savory, protein-rich stew made primarily from
      Honey beans (Oloyin) or Brown beans. Unlike a soup, the texture is thick
      and "mushy," with the beans partially breaking down to create a natural
      gravy. It is defined by its deep orange color from unrefined palm oil and
      a distinct savory-sweetness, often enhanced by ground crayfish and smoked
      fish. It is traditionally served with fried plantain (dodo), bread, or
      soaked garri.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups Honey beans or Brown beans</li>
      <li>
        1 large Onion (diced), 2-3 Scotch Bonnet peppers (Atarodo), 1 Red Bell
        Pepper (Tatashe)
      </li>
      <li>
        1/2 cup Red Palm Oil, 2 tbsp Ground Crayfish, 1-2 Seasoning cubes, Salt
        to taste
      </li>
      <li>Smoked fish (Deboned), Dry prawns, or precooked Ponmo (Cow skin)</li>
      <li>
        1-2 Ripe Plantains (diced and added into the pot, or fried separately)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Clean and Pre-boil:</strong> Pick through the beans to remove
        stones. Wash and place them in a pot with enough water to cover them.
        Boil for 10 to 15 minutes, then drain and rinse (this helps reduce
        bloating/gas).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Softening Phase: </strong> Return the beans to the pot with
        fresh water and half of the diced onions. Cook on medium heat until the
        beans are very tender. Note: Do not add salt yet, as salt can prevent
        beans from softening quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Sauce: </strong> While the beans cook, blend the
        peppers and the remaining onions into a coarse consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine: </strong> Once the beans are soft, ensure the water
        level is just slightly above the beans. Add the blended pepper mix, palm
        oil, crayfish, seasoning cubes, and smoked fish/prawns.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simmer and Mash: </strong> Stir well and let it simmer on
        low-medium heat for about 10 to 15 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to
        slightly mash some of the beans against the side of the pot to thicken
        the porridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Final Seasoning: </strong>Add salt to taste. If you like your
        plantains cooked inside the beans, add the diced ripe plantains now and
        cook for another 5 minutes until they are soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rest:</strong> Turn off the heat and let the porridge sit for 5
        minutes before serving; it thickens even more as it cools.
      </li>
    </ol>
